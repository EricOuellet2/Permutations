# Permutations
Implementations of permutations algorithms. 
Implementations of an algorithm that manage permutation indexing. 
Benchmark to test permutation algorithms.

Also include Sani Singh Huttunen permutation algorithm implementation which is the fastest to find all permutations in a lexicographic order.

Implementation of permutation heap algorithm (fastest way to generate all permutations) in single thread.
Implementation of an algorithm which index each permutation and reverse of it.
Implementation of the fastest multithreaded implementation of an algorithm that generate all permutations using a mix of Sani Singh Huttunen algorithm and my algorithm which index each permutation.

The benchmark is done in WPF.

Licence: CPOL (Code Project Open Licence) https://www.codeproject.com/info/cpol10.aspx

I have Sani Singh Huttunen agreement for the licence.
